# AI therapist

AI therapist that listens and offers advice when asked.

I'm using:
- OpenAI's Whisper for speech-to-text
- OpenAI's LLM
- AWS Polly for text-to-speech   # should use OpenAI's API instead, voice quality is better

Also using nifty [audio recorder](https://pypi.org/project/audio-recorder-streamlit/).   

The whole UI needs asynchronicity, see todo.py.
